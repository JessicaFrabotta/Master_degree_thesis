# Grasping System for Humanoid Robots

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a grasping system for unknown objects using a humanoid robot within the **QiBullet simulator**.  
The system enables a **Softbank Robotics Pepper robot** to detect, localize, and grasp objects without requiring additional markers or sensors beyond its default hardware.

## üöÄ Features

- **Object Detection**: Uses **YOLOv10** to identify and place bounding boxes around target objects in images captured by Pepper‚Äôs cameras.  
- **Monocular Depth Estimation**: Leverages **Depth Anything V2** to estimate object distances and generate a depth map.  
- **Coordinate Mapping**: Transforms image coordinates into Pepper‚Äôs base coordinate system to compute object positions in 3D space.  
- **Path Planning**: Implements an algorithm to generate an optimal path for the arm, adjusting position and orientation for the best grasp pose.  
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Uses the **Playful Kinematics framework** to compute joint configurations, considering both arm DOF (5 per arm) and lower body DOF.  
- **Robustness**: Achieved a **72% success rate** when grasping a small bottle in **25 simulated tests**.  
- **Modularity**: Easily adaptable to other humanoid robots thanks to modular implementation.

## üéØ Project Goals and Contributions

The main goal is to enable the **Pepper robot**, which was not originally designed for precise grasping, to perform complex grasping tasks using **only its default sensors**.  

- Contributes to the state of the art by addressing grasping with humanoid robots similar to Pepper.  
- Demonstrates the feasibility of grasping strategies in simulation, reducing costs and risks compared to real-world testing.  
- Provides a modular pipeline that can be extended to other humanoid platforms.
